### Component Descriptions and Roles:

1. **Arduino Uno**: The main controller that processes data from the sensors and controls the motors, servo, and water pump.
2. **L298N Motor Driver**: This module controls the two DC motors connected to the wheels, allowing the robot to move forward, backward, and turn.
3. **DC Motors**: Provide the actual movement for the robot, allowing it to navigate towards the flame and avoid obstacles.
4. **Servo Motor**: The servo motor is used to rotate the ultrasonic sensor, enabling it to scan for obstacles around the robot.
5. **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**: Measures the distance to obstacles, allowing the robot to detect and avoid obstacles while navigating.
6. **Flame Sensor**: Detects flames in the surroundings. Once a flame is detected, the robot activates the water pump.
7. **Water Pump Module**: Pumps water through the nozzle to extinguish flames once they are detected.
8. **Relay Module**: Acts as a switch to turn the water pump on and off based on signals from the Arduino.
9. **Line Follower Sensors**: Help in guiding the robot along pre-defined paths or lines, useful if the robot needs to follow a specific route.
10. **Wheels**: Connected to the DC motors, allowing the robot to move in different directions.
11. **Battery Pack**: Supplies power to the Arduino, motors, and sensors. Use a 9V or 12V battery, depending on the motor specifications.
12. **Jumper Wires**: Used to connect the components with the Arduino board.
13. **Breadboard (optional)**: Helpful for organizing and testing connections before soldering.

> **Note:** Ensure all components are compatible with each other in terms of voltage and current specifications. Double-check the pin configurations for each component before wiring.
